# Architecture Capability

> **Architecture Capability** is the organizational ability to effectively practice Enterprise Architecture — encompassing people, processes, tools, skills, and governance.

---

## Purpose

Architecture Capability ensures that:
- The organization can **perform EA activities** effectively
- EA delivers **business value** consistently
- Architecture practice is **sustainable** and scalable
- Resources and skills are **available** to support EA
- **Governance** ensures architecture compliance

---

## What is Architecture Capability?

Architecture Capability is the combination of:
- **People** — Roles, organization, skills
- **Processes** — Methods, procedures, ADM
- **Tools** — Technology supporting EA
- **Governance** — Oversight and compliance
- **Culture** — Organizational support for architecture

It's established in the **Preliminary Phase** and continuously maintained.
