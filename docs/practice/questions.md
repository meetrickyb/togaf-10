## Additional Practice Tips

1. **Time yourself** — Practice answering in 1.5 minutes per question
2. **Identify patterns** — Notice common wrong answer types
3. **Understand rationale** — Don't just memorize; understand why
4. **Review all explanations** — Even for questions you got right
5. **Focus on weak areas** — Spend more time on topics you struggle with
6. **Use official terminology** — Familiarize yourself with exact TOGAF terms
7. **Practice elimination** — Rule out obviously wrong answers first
8. **Watch for absolutes** — "Always", "never", "only" are often incorrect
