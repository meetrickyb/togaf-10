# Phase H: Architecture Change Management

> Phase H ensures the architecture **remains relevant** by managing changes, monitoring implementation, and continuously improving the architecture practice.

---

## Purpose

Phase H provides **ongoing governance** of the architecture after implementation:
- Monitor changes in the enterprise and technology landscape
- Assess impact of changes on architecture
- Manage architecture change process
- Maintain architecture lifecycle
- Ensure architecture stays aligned with business

This phase ensures the architecture is a **living asset**, not a static document.

   - Communicate to stakeholders

### Change Request Categories

## Relationship to Other Phases

| Phase | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **Phase G** | Provides lessons learned and change requests to Phase H |
| **Preliminary** | Phase H may trigger update to architecture framework |
| **Phase A** | Phase H launches new architecture cycles starting at Phase A |
| **All phases** | Phase H determines which phases to invoke for changes |
| **Requirements Mgmt** | Continuous requirement management operates alongside Phase H |

Phase H is **continuous** — it never really ends, transitioning to new ADM cycles as needed.
