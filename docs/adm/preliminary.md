# Preliminary Phase

> The Preliminary Phase prepares the organization for successful EA projects by defining "**where, what, why, who, and how**" architecture will be practiced in the enterprise.

---

## Purpose

The Preliminary Phase is about **preparation and initiation** — establishing or enhancing the Enterprise Architecture (EA) capability within an organization before embarking on architecture development.

This phase ensures that the architecture effort:
- Aligns with business directives
- Has appropriate organizational support
- Uses an appropriate, tailored framework
- Follows defined principles and governance

---

## Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Define the enterprise** | Determine scope of organizations impacted |
| **Identify stakeholders** | Confirm governance and support frameworks |
| **Establish EA team** | Define and establish the EA team and organization |
| **Define principles** | Identify and establish Architecture Principles |
| **Tailor TOGAF** | Customize TOGAF framework for organizational needs |
| **Implement tools** | Develop strategy for EA tools and techniques |

---

## Key Questions Answered

The Preliminary Phase answers:
- **Where** do we do architecture? (scope)
- **What** kind of architecture do we need? (domains, deliverables)
- **Why** are we doing architecture? (drivers, goals)
- **Who** is involved? (stakeholders, governance)
- **How** do we do architecture? (framework, principles, processes)

---

## Inputs

| Input | Source |
|-------|--------|
| **Board strategies and plans** | Business strategy documents |
| **Business principles, goals, drivers** | Corporate planning |
| **Governance and legal frameworks** | Compliance requirements |
| **Architecture frameworks** | TOGAF, industry frameworks |
| **Existing EA capability** | Current EA practices (if any) |
| **Partnership agreements** | Collaborations with other organizations |

---

## Steps

### 1. Scope the Enterprise Organizations Impacted
- Define the breadth of the enterprise to be addressed
- Identify all organizations, business units, and partners affected
- Determine geographic scope

### 2. Confirm Governance and Support Frameworks
- Review existing governance structures
- Identify sponsorship and stakeholder support
- Align with corporate governance processes
- Establish reporting lines

### 3. Define and Establish EA Team and Organization
- Determine EA team structure and roles
- Define responsibilities and authorities
- Establish architecture board (or equivalent)
- Identify required skills and competencies

### 4. Identify and Establish Architecture Principles
- Define business principles
- Define architecture principles
- Ensure principles align with business goals
- Document rationale and implications for each principle

### 5. Tailor TOGAF Framework
- Customize ADM to organizational needs
- Adapt terminology to organizational language
- Select relevant deliverables and artifacts
- Integrate with existing frameworks and methods

### 6. Implement Architecture Tools
- Select EA tools and repositories
- Define modeling standards and notations
- Establish architecture repository structure
- Plan for tool deployment and training

---

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Organizational Model for EA** | Structure, roles, responsibilities for EA function |
| **Tailored Architecture Framework** | Customized TOGAF with adapted processes and deliverables |
| **Initial Architecture Repository** | Starting structure for storing architecture assets |
| **Architecture Principles** | Documented principles with rationale and implications |
| **Request for Architecture Work** | Optional trigger for Phase A (if applicable) |
| **Architecture Governance Framework** | Processes and structures for oversight and compliance |

---

## Architecture Principles

Principles are **general rules and guidelines** intended to be enduring and guide architecture work.

### Structure of a Principle

Each principle should have:

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Clear, memorable title | Data is an Asset |
| **Statement** | Concise description of the rule | Data is a valuable corporate asset that has value beyond immediate transaction |
| **Rationale** | Why this principle exists | Accurate and timely data is critical for decision-making |
| **Implications** | Consequences and requirements | Requires data governance, stewardship, and quality management |

### Example Principles

| Principle | Statement |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Maximize Benefit to the Enterprise** | Decisions are made to maximize enterprise benefit rather than local optimization |
| **Business Continuity** | Operations are designed to ensure continuity despite system failures |
| **Compliance with Law** | Enterprise processes comply with all relevant laws and regulations |
| **Data is an Asset** | Data is managed as a valuable enterprise asset |
| **Reuse Before Buy, Buy Before Build** | Existing solutions are reused; COTS is preferred over custom development |
| **Technology Independence** | Applications are independent of specific technology choices |

---

## Tailoring the ADM

Organizations should adapt TOGAF to their context by:

### 1. Terminology Adaptation
- Use organizational language (e.g., "solution" vs "application")
- Align role names with existing job titles
- Match document names to corporate standards

### 2. Process Integration
- Integrate ADM with existing processes (SDLC, project management)
- Align with Agile, DevOps, or other methodologies
- Connect to portfolio management processes

### 3. Content Customization
- Select relevant deliverables for organizational needs
- Adapt templates to corporate standards
- Define organization-specific viewpoints

### 4. Governance Alignment
- Connect to existing governance boards
- Align decision-making processes
- Integrate compliance requirements

## Architecture Capability

The Preliminary Phase establishes the **Architecture Capability** — the organizational ability to practice EA effectively.

Components include:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Skills and roles** | EA practitioners, domain architects, business analysts |
| **Processes** | ADM, governance, change management |
| **Tools** | Modeling tools, repositories, collaboration platforms |
| **Governance** | Architecture board, review processes, compliance |
| **Standards** | Modeling notations, documentation templates |
| **Communications** | Stakeholder engagement, reporting mechanisms |

---

## Relationship to Other Phases

| Phase | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **Phase A** | Preliminary establishes the framework that Phase A operates within |
| **All ADM phases** | Provides governance, principles, and framework used throughout |
| **Requirements Mgmt** | Establishes the process for managing requirements continuously |

The Preliminary Phase is typically executed **once** to establish the EA capability, then revisited periodically (e.g., annually) to refresh the framework.

---

## Exam Tips

- Preliminary Phase is about **preparation**, not developing architecture
- Key outputs: **Architecture Principles**, **Tailored Framework**, **EA Organization**
- Architecture Principles have four parts: **Name, Statement, Rationale, Implications**
- Preliminary answers "**where, what, why, who, and how**" of doing EA
- This phase establishes the **Architecture Capability**
- TOGAF should be **tailored** to organizational needs — one size does not fit all
- Preliminary is typically done **once** at the start, then refreshed periodically
