# Phase A: Architecture Vision

> Phase A creates a high-level **aspirational vision** of the target architecture and obtains approval to proceed with architecture development.

---

## Purpose

Phase A is the **"elevator pitch"** phase — where architects sell the benefits of the proposed architecture to decision-makers and gain approval for the architecture project.

This phase establishes:
- **What** is the scope of the architecture work?
- **Why** is this architecture effort needed?
- **Who** are the stakeholders and what are their concerns?
- **What value** will the architecture deliver?

| **Obtain approval** | Get formal approval to proceed (Statement of Architecture Work) |
| **Define scope** | Establish boundaries and constraints for the architecture effort |
| **Identify stakeholders** | Determine relevant stakeholders, concerns, and objectives |
| **Validate business context** | Confirm business principles, goals, and drivers |
| **Define constraints** | Identify budget, time, resource, and technical constraints |

## Key Artifacts in Architecture Vision

### 1. Business Scenarios
- Technique for discovering and documenting business requirements
- Describes business process, actors, and desired outcome
- Identifies problems and solution requirements

### 2. Architecture Vision Document
Contains:
- **Problem description** — What problem are we solving?
- **Objective** — What are we trying to achieve?
- **Baseline summary** — Where are we now?
- **Target summary** — Where do we want to be?
- **Value proposition** — What benefits will we realize?
- **Solution overview** — How will we get there (high-level)?

### 3. Stakeholder Map Matrix

| Stakeholder | Role | Concerns | Influence | Support Level |
|-------------|------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| CFO | Sponsor | Cost, ROI | High | Strong |
| CIO | Owner | IT alignment, risk | High | Moderate |
| Business Units | Users | Functionality, ease of use | Medium | Variable |

### 4. Value Chain Diagrams
- Show how capabilities create value
- Link architecture to business outcomes
- Demonstrate end-to-end value flow

---

## Architecture Scope

Phase A establishes scope across **four dimensions**:

### 1. Breadth (Enterprise Scope)
What part of the enterprise is covered?
- Entire enterprise
- Specific business units
- Particular domains or capabilities
- Geographic regions

### 2. Depth (Level of Detail)
How much detail is required?
- Strategic overview
- Segment-level detail
- Capability-level detail

### 3. Architecture Domains (BDAT)
Which architecture domains are addressed?
- Business Architecture
- Data Architecture
- Application Architecture
- Technology Architecture

### 4. Time Period (Planning Horizon)
What timeframe does the architecture cover?
- Short-term (6-12 months)
- Medium-term (1-3 years)
- Long-term (3-5 years)

## Statement of Architecture Work

The **Statement of Architecture Work** is the formal contract between the architecture team and sponsor.

### Contents

## Business Transformation Readiness Assessment

Assesses the organization's ability to accept and execute transformation.

### Readiness Factors

| Factor | Assessment Questions |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Vision** | Is there a clear, compelling vision? |
| **Desire** | Do stakeholders want the change? |
| **Need** | Is there a business case for change? |
| **Leadership** | Is there executive sponsorship? |
| **Resources** | Are adequate resources available? |
| **Skills** | Does the organization have necessary capabilities? |
| **Culture** | Is the culture supportive of change? |

Readiness assessment helps identify:
- Transformation risks
- Required change management activities
- Sequencing of initiatives based on readiness

## Stakeholder Management

### Stakeholder Analysis

Identify for each stakeholder:
- **Concerns** — What matters to them?
- **Influence** — How much power do they have?
- **Support level** — Champion, supporter, neutral, skeptic, blocker?

### Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

| Support Level | Engagement Strategy |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Champion** | Leverage as advocate; involve in key decisions |
| **Supporter** | Keep informed; maintain enthusiasm |
| **Neutral** | Educate on benefits; address uncertainties |
| **Skeptic** | Listen to concerns; provide evidence and quick wins |
| **Blocker** | Understand objections; mitigate concerns; escalate if needed |

## Relationship to Other Phases

| Phase | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| **Preliminary** | Provides framework, principles, and governance for Phase A |
| **Phases B, C, D** | Vision guides detailed architecture development |
| **Phase E** | Vision informs solution identification and planning |
| **Requirements Mgmt** | Captures initial requirements; iterates as vision evolves |

Phase A may iterate:
- If stakeholder feedback requires vision revision
- If scope or constraints change
- If new business drivers emerge

- Key output is **Statement of Architecture Work** (the contract)
- The Vision is an **"elevator pitch"** — high-level and compelling
- **Business Scenarios** are a key technique for discovering requirements
- Architecture scope has **four dimensions**: breadth, depth, domains, time
- **Stakeholder management** is critical in Phase A
- **Business Transformation Readiness** assesses ability to accept change
- Architecture Vision includes **baseline** (current) and **target** (future) summaries
- Phase A answers: **What, Why, Who, and What value?**
